## Technology Stack :file_folder: :desktop_computer:
In this assignemnt, we used Flask to create call to Spotify API in the backend and to show the result. We decided to use Flask because 
it is supposedly easy to learn, and better for us who know Python and are new to the backend coding. Therefore, we went with Flask.  

For the rest of the project, we are considering using Flask or Node.js as some of us prefer Javascript. 
And since the frontend is planned to be in React, we could have the whole app in one language.
