# Estimation

### User story: “As a user, I want to be able to pick whether I am looking for off-campus housing or on-campus housing.”

Since this story involves user preferences, we will be required to build user tables, create a page and interface through which users can pick their preferences, write queries, write code to ensure that the the user's preferences are properly filtered, and make sure that the application properly saves new information. In case of error, user data should be stored in multiple places, and hash tables for specific preferences should be created. Additionally, thorough testing is neccessary.

Time estimates
1 hour: build user tables
3 hours: create a page/interface through which users can pick their preferences
30 minutes: write queries
30 minutes: auth
1 hour: user data storage/ data sets
30 minutes: error code
1 hour: hash table creation
2 hours: testing
