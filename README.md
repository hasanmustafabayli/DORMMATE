### Project description:
Introducing "*DormMate*" - the ultimate solution for university students looking for a roommate. Our blog-like app offers a user-friendly interface that allows you to browse and match with potential roommates from your university or nearby universities. Users can scroll through potential roommates and view their descriptions to determine if they're a good match. The app requires users to sign up with their gmail email address. User needs to pick their most preferred location on/off campus to display at their personal site. *DormMate* is designed to help students avoid the uncertainty of living with a stranger and provide a platform to find a compatible roommate with ease.
